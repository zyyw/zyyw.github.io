end-of-file character (usually Control-D)

Unbuffered I/O: 
<unistd.h>; open, read, write, lseek, and close.
Standard I/O:
<stdio.h>; printf, scanf, fgets, getc

compare:  The standard I/O functions also simplify dealing with lines of input (a common occurrence in UNIX applications). The fgets function, for example, reads an entire line. The read function, in contrast, reads a specified number of bytes.
